# üöÄ mc-install-tunnel: Zero to Minecraft in 60 Seconds Flat

**Tired of server setup hell?** This script nukes the complexity of running your own Minecraft server. One command and you're hosting a world with public access through Ngrok. No networking degree required.

## ‚ú® What This Script Actually Does

- **One-Command Installation:** Handles Java, dependencies, and server files without asking you 50 questions
- **Auto-Updates PaperMC:** Downloads the latest version so you're not running ancient code
- **"It Just Works" Ngrok Integration:** Bypasses your router's security so friends can connect instantly
- **Set & Forget:** Runs in background with screen so you can close your terminal without killing your world
- **Won't Eat Your RAM:** Configure memory limits that make sense for your machine
- **Crash Protection:** Auto-restart capabilities when things inevitably go sideways

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- A Linux machine/VM that isn't a complete potato
- Sudo privileges (or a friend who has them)
- For remote play: Free Ngrok account with auth token ([ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/))
- Basic typing skills

## üî• Quick Start

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/CodersPlanetHQ/MinecraftServerSetup.git
cd MinecraftServerSetup

# Make it executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Launch it
./install.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `install.sh` to personalize these values:

```bash
SERVER_DIR="/opt/minecraft"       # Where your world will live
INITIAL_MEMORY="1G"               # Starting RAM allocation
MAX_MEMORY="4G"                   # Max RAM (don't be greedy)
SERVER_PORT=25565                 # Standard MC port
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="paste_token"     # Your Ngrok auth token
PAPER_VERSION="latest"            # or specify like "1.20.1"
```

## üéÆ Daily Usage

**Start the server:**
```bash
cd /path/to/script && ./start.sh
```

**Access console:**
```bash
screen -r mcserver
```

**Exit console while keeping server running:**
Press `Ctrl+A` then `D`

**Execute server commands:**
```bash
screen -S mcserver -X stuff "say Hello everyone!$(printf '\r')"
```

**Gracefully shutdown:**
```bash
screen -S mcserver -X stuff "save-all$(printf '\r')"
screen -S mcserver -X stuff "stop$(printf '\r')"
```

## üåé Connecting to Your Server

1. After starting, check the console output for your Ngrok address
2. Or visit `http://localhost:4040` to see connection details
3. Share the address with friends (looks like `mc.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`)
4. Enjoy being called a "technical wizard" by your friends

## üö® Troubleshooting

**Server crashes on start:**
* Check Java version (needs Java 17+)
* Increase RAM allocation if you have complex mods
* Check logs in `logs/latest.log`

**Nobody can connect via Ngrok:**
* Verify your auth token is correct
* Make sure Ngrok service is running (`ps aux | grep ngrok`)
* Check if your server is actually running (`screen -ls`)

**Performance issues:**
* Lower view-distance in server.properties
* Check for resource-hungry mods/plugins
* Consider dedicating more RAM (if available)

## üîÑ Updating Your Server

```bash
# Stop the server first!
cd /path/to/server
./update.sh
```

The script will backup your world, download the latest PaperMC, and preserve your configs.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

* Change the default ops level in server.properties
* Use a whitelist if you don't want random players
* Consider setting up a firewall if exposing directly (non-Ngrok)
* Don't run as root (the script handles permissions properly)

## üìù Final Notes

This script was created by someone who spent too many hours of their life setting up Minecraft servers manually. If this saves you time, consider buying me a coffee or naming your next diamond pickaxe after me.

**Remember:** Always comply with the Minecraft EULA. No selling in-game advantages for real money or Mojang will find you.
